Tensorflow core learning algorithms:

these are not specific to tensorflow but are in the library

    - Linear Regression
    - classification
    - clustering
    - hidden markov model

Linear Regression:

linear regression essentially tries to find a linear correspondance between datapoints
so linear regression is basically trying to produce the most accurate line of best fit.


linear regression is useful since it is a basic and simple method of finding a
relationship between data points its downside is that since it is a straight line the
equation for the line must be linear, and non-exponential whereas polynomial regression
produces non-linear lines.

on a 2d graph a line can be defined as y=mx +b

m is the gradient which is calculated using rise/run
y is the coordinate of the dependent variable or Label
x is the coordinate of the independent variable or Label.
b is the y-intercept.
